My project is based on the Musify app where you can find details of your favourite artists,albums and songs

What i have learnt from this project is about MVP/Web API controller,views and models how they work together 

I have gotten stuck at the foriegn key of artist in album and song model ,i wasnt able to bridge that connection then your videos helped me.

Next i would like to work on the adding cover pictures of artist and albums but didnt able to do this time beacuse of lots of pending work
One more feature to add play browser in songs where user can play their favourite songs.

Resourses:
Your videos and varsity github
